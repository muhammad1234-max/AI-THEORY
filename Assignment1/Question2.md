### Current Capabilities of AI in Various Tasks

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent decades, but its capabilities vary widely across different tasks. Over here i will examine the current state of AI in eight specific tasks, highlighting achievements, limitations, and the difficulties involved.I have referenced the sources i read as well.

### **1. Playing a Decent Game of Table Tennis (Ping-Pong)**
Many advances in robotic control and physical tasks have been made, but playing table tennis at a human-competitive level remains a significant challenge. While robots like **Omron's FORPHEUS** can play table tennis, they are limited by the need for precise motor control, real-time decision-making, and adaptability to unpredictable human opponents. The primary difficulties include lacking in motor Skills as the robots must execute precise, high-speed movements, which require advanced actuators and control systems. Real-Time Adaptation as unlike games with fixed rules (e.g., chess), table tennis requires real-time adaptation to a human opponent's style and spin. Perception based descion making like accurately tracking the ball's trajectory and spin in real-time is computationally intensive.

### **2. Playing a Decent Game of Bridge at a Competitive Level**
Bridge is a complex card game that involves not only strategy but also **teamwork** and **communication**. While AI has excelled in games like chess and Go, bridge poses unique challenges due to its **imperfect information** and **partnership dynamics**. In 2020, **Facebook's AI system, Pluribus**, demonstrated success in poker, another imperfect information game, but bridge remains more complex. The difficulties include:
- **Communication**: Bridge requires implicit or implied communication between partners like physical tells or signs, which is difficult for AI to replicate.
- **Incomplete Information**: Unlike chess, where all information is visible, bridge involves hidden cards, requiring probabilistic or random reasoning.

### **3. Writing an Intentionally Funny Story**
AI has made significant progress in **natural language generation (NLG)**, with models like **OpenAI's GPT-4** capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text. However, writing a **funny story** requires **creativity**, **cultural context**, and **emotional intelligence**, which are still beyond the reach of current AI. While AI can generate humorous content, it often lacks the subtlety and timing that make humor effective. The difficulties include:
- **Understanding Humor**: Humor relies on cultural nuances,current trends, wordplay, and timing, which are difficult for AI to grasp.
- **Creativity**: AI lacks the ability to generate truly original and contextually appropriate jokes.

### **4. Giving Competent Legal Advice in a Specialized Area of Law**
AI has been increasingly used in the legal field, with systems like **ROSS Intelligence** and **LexisNexis** providing legal research and document analysis. However, giving **competent legal advice** requires not only access to legal databases but also **interpretation**, **judgment**, and **ethical considerations**, and a lack oh **bias** in its desicion making process which are challenging for AI. The difficulties include:
- **Interpretation**: Legal advice often requires interpreting ambiguous laws and precedents.
- **Ethical Judgment**: AI lacks the ability to make ethical decisions or understand the human context of legal issues.like being moved by emotion like a jury is convinced.

### **5. Discovering and Proving a New Mathematical Theorem**
AI has been used to assist in mathematical research, but **discovering and proving new theorems** autonomously remains a challenge. In 2021, **DeepMind's AlphaTensor** demonstrated the ability to discover new algorithms for matrix multiplication, but this is a far cry from proving complex theorems in fields like number theory or topology. The difficulties include:
- **Abstract Reasoning**: Proving theorems often requires abstract and creative reasoning, which AI struggles with.
- **Mathematical Intuition**: Human mathematicians rely on intuition and insight,often time experimentation which results in ne discovery which are difficult to formalize in algorithms.

### **6. Performing a Surgical Operation**
AI has been integrated into surgical systems, such as **da Vinci Surgical System**, to assist surgeons with precision and control. However, fully autonomous surgical operations are not yet feasible due to the need for **real-time decision-making**, **adaptability**, and **ethical considerations**. The difficulties include:
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Surgery often requires adapting to unexpected complications, which is challenging for AI.
- **Ethical and Legal Issues**: Autonomous surgery raises significant ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding accountability and a lack of trust by patients to put their lives in the hands of machines

### **7. Unloading Any Dishwasher in Any Home**
Unloading a dishwasher is a **dexterous** and **context-dependent** task but is something that is within the capacity of todays AI systems like smart home systems that has automated all such household tasks.An example is robots like **Boston Dynamics' Spot** can perform complex physical tasks, and it is well within its purview to perform this.

### **8. Constructing a Building**
AI and robotics have been used in construction for tasks like **3D printing** and **automated bricklaying**, but constructing an entire building autonomously is not yet feasible. The difficulties include:
- **Complexity**: Construction involves a wide range of tasks, from planning to execution, which require coordination and adaptability.
- **Safety and Regulation**: Autonomous construction raises significant safety and regulatory challenges.
