Let's walk through the **Genetic Algorithm** step-by-step, and then do a **detailed dry run of Generation 1**, as if we're simulating it manually.

## 🔁 Genetic Algorithm: Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Chromosome Representation**
- Each chromosome represents one complete solution: assigning each task to one of 3 facilities.
- It’s a list of 7 integers (because there are 7 tasks).
- Each gene in the chromosome is a number between `0` and `2`, representing:
  - `0` = Facility 1
  - `1` = Facility 2
  - `2` = Facility 3  
Example:
```python
chromosome = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1]
# Task 1 -> Facility 1, Task 2 -> Facility 3, ...
```

---

### 2. **Initial Population (Random Generation)**
- We generate 6 chromosomes randomly (population size = 6).
- These are our 6 "candidate solutions".

---

### 3. **Fitness Calculation**
For each chromosome:
- Track the total time assigned to each facility.
- Compute the total cost:
  - For each task, calculate: `task_time * cost[task][assigned_facility]`
- If a facility's capacity is exceeded, **apply a heavy penalty** to discourage the solution.

---

### 4. **Selection: Roulette Wheel**
- Select parents based on inverse fitness (lower cost = higher chance).
- Roulette Wheel:
  - Convert fitness to a probability distribution.
  - Select parents probabilistically.

---

### 5. **Crossover (Recombination)**
- Perform **one-point crossover** on selected parents with 80% probability.
- Pick a random point, and swap parts of the chromosome to create 2 children.

---

### 6. **Mutation**
- With 20% chance per chromosome, perform a **swap mutation**:
  - Pick two random tasks and swap their facility assignments.

---

### 7. **Replacement**
- Replace old population with the new one (children become new population).

## 🧪 Generation 1: Dry Run Example

### ✅ Task Setup:
- Task Times: `[5, 8, 4, 7, 6, 3, 9]`
- Capacities: `[24, 30, 28]`
- Cost Matrix:

| Task | F1 | F2 | F3 |
|------|----|----|----|
| 1    | 10 | 12 |  9 |
| 2    | 15 | 14 | 16 |
| 3    |  8 |  9 |  7 |
| 4    | 12 | 10 | 13 |
| 5    | 14 | 13 | 12 |
| 6    |  9 |  8 | 10 |
| 7    | 11 | 12 | 13 |

---

### 👥 Step 1: Initial Population (Generated Randomly)
Suppose the initial population is:

| Chromosome Index | Chromosome                 |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| C1               | [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]       |
| C2               | [1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]       |
| C3               | [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]       |
| C4               | [0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1]       |
| C5               | [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1]       |
| C6               | [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]       |

---

### 📏 Step 2: Fitness Calculation (We'll do for C1 and C2)

#### ➤ C1: [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
- Facility 1 gets Tasks 1, 2, 5 → 5 + 8 + 6 = **19 hrs** ✅
- Facility 2 gets Tasks 3, 6 → 4 + 3 = **7 hrs** ✅
- Facility 3 gets Tasks 4, 7 → 7 + 9 = **16 hrs** ✅

**Total Cost**:
- Task 1 → F1: 5 × 10 = 50  
- Task 2 → F1: 8 × 15 = 120  
- Task 3 → F2: 4 × 9 = 36  
- Task 4 → F3: 7 × 13 = 91  
- Task 5 → F1: 6 × 14 = 84  
- Task 6 → F2: 3 × 8 = 24  
- Task 7 → F3: 9 × 13 = 117  

**Total Cost = 50 + 120 + 36 + 91 + 84 + 24 + 117 = 522**

✅ No capacity violation  
🔁 **Fitness = 522**

---

#### ➤ C2: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]
- F1 gets Tasks 4, 7 → 7 + 9 = **16 hrs** ✅
- F2 gets Tasks 1, 2, 3 → 5 + 8 + 4 = **17 hrs** ✅
- F3 gets Tasks 5, 6 → 6 + 3 = **9 hrs** ✅

**Total Cost**:
- T1 → F2: 5 × 12 = 60  
- T2 → F2: 8 × 14 = 112  
- T3 → F2: 4 × 9 = 36  
- T4 → F1: 7 × 12 = 84  
- T5 → F3: 6 × 12 = 72  
- T6 → F3: 3 × 10 = 30  
- T7 → F1: 9 × 11 = 99  

**Total = 60 + 112 + 36 + 84 + 72 + 30 + 99 = 493**

✅ No violation  
🔁 **Fitness = 493**

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Selection (Roulette Wheel)

Let’s suppose:
- Total inverse fitness = 1/522 + 1/493 + … (calculated for all)
- Higher chance of selecting C2 (lower cost)

We randomly pick **2 parents**, say:
- Parent1 = C2
- Parent2 = C5

---

### 🔀 Step 4: Crossover

C2 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]  
C5 = [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1]

Suppose crossover point = 3

**Child1 =** [1, 1, 1] + [2, 2, 2, 1] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]  
**Child2 =** [1, 0, 0] + [0, 2, 2, 0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]

---

### 🧬 Step 5: Mutation

Suppose Child1 is selected for mutation.

Before: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]  
Random swap (say positions 1 and 6):  
After: [1, **1**, 1, 2, 2, 2, **1**] → [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1] (no change)

(If different genes, it would change)

---

### 👶 Step 6: Create Next Generation

Assume we repeat crossover/mutation until we have 6 children.

New generation becomes:
- [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
- [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
- ...
- (6 total children)

And **Generation 1 ends**, moving to Generation 2.

| C1         | 522     | Valid              |
| C2         | 493     | Selected parent    |
| C3–C6      | ...     | Other candidates   |
