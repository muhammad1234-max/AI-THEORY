## how is my code different 

1. Algorithm Used:
My Version: Uses AC-3 for constraint propagation and backtracking for solving, which is manually implemented with basic heuristics.

Google OR-Tools: Uses Constraint Programming with highly optimized algorithms, including advanced heuristics like variable ordering and constraint propagation.

ChatGPT Version: Typically uses backtracking with simple constraint propagation, less optimized than OR-Tools.

2. Optimization:
My Version: Basic optimizations like AC-3, but may not be the fastest, especially for larger puzzles.

Google OR-Tools: Highly optimized for efficiency, leveraging advanced heuristics and automatic propagation, which makes it faster and more scalable.

ChatGPT Version: Less optimized than OR-Tools, relies on simpler backtracking and basic heuristics.

3. Scalability:
My Version: Works well for 9x9 puzzles, but may struggle with larger grids.

Google OR-Tools: Scales well for large puzzles and complex problems.

ChatGPT Version: Works for smaller puzzles but may not scale as well as OR-Tools.

4. Flexibility:
My Version: Fully customizable and gives more control over the algorithms.

Google OR-Tools: Less customizable but very powerful and easy to use for constraint satisfaction problems.

ChatGPT Version: Easier to implement but offers less flexibility and optimization.

5. Ease of Use:
My Version: Requires more manual coding and understanding of algorithms.

Google OR-Tools: Easier to use with built-in solvers and less code required.

ChatGPT Version: Quick to implement with basic algorithms but may not perform as well for larger problems.

Summary:
My Version: Gives full control but may not be as fast or scalable.

Google OR-Tools: Highly efficient and scalable, but less flexible.

ChatGPT Version: Simpler to implement but less optimized.

## how can the code be improved
I can improve my version by adding advanced heuristics and optimizations like degree heuristics or parallelizing backtracking.
